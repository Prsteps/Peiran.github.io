  * [**Bachelor of Science** in Computer Science](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/academics/cscin/){: .no-underline-black-link }; Cumulative GPA: **3.757**/4.000.
  * Member of **[ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite){: .no-underline-black-link }** of [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/){: .no-underline-black-link }; Member of **[S.H. Ho College](https://www.shho.cuhk.edu.hk){: .no-underline-black-link }**.
  * Spring Semester Exchange to [IC School](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/){: .no-underline-black-link }, [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne **(EPFL)**](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){: .no-underline-black-link }, 2023-24.
  * Spring Semester Exchange to [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/){: .no-underline-black-link }, [Peking University **(PKU)**](https://english.pku.edu.cn){: .no-underline-black-link }, 2022-23.
* Ranked **top 0.4%** among 110,000 science students in the 2021 National College Entrance Exam.


## Research Experience

* **Fact or Fairness? Identifying Over-Balanced Issues** (Apr. 2024 - present)
  * Research project cooperated with [Dr. Jen-tse Huang](https://penguinnnnn.github.io)) and supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home) ([ARISE](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/){: .no-underline-black-link }@CUHK).
  * More details are to be updated.

* **Evaluation on the Vulnerability of Current Generative Models** (Jan. 2024 - present)
  * Semester project cooperated with [Dr. Daichi Zhang](https://daisy-zhang.github.io/) and supervised by [Prof. Sabine Süsstrunk](https://people.epfl.ch/sabine.susstrunk?lang=en) ([IVRL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/){: .no-underline-black-link }@EPFL).
  * Investigated potential data leakage in generative models due to their access to extensive training datasets and user inputs, assessing the risk of compromised output.
  * Evaluated and enforced fairness in generated content, preventing model output biases.
  * Conducted robustness checks against adversarial attacks, validating model resilience by identifying vulnerabilities to deliberate input perturbations aimed at manipulating results.

* **Efficient Video Analytics** (Jun. 2023 - Sep. 2023)[[Poster](https://YanY-Henry.github.io/files/SummerResearch2023_Poster.pdf)]
  * Research Assistant to [Prof. Eric Chi Lik LO](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/eric-chi-lik-lo/) ([CPII](https://www.cpii.hk){: .no-underline-black-link }@CUHK).
  * Won the **Best Project Award 2023** among 58 undergraduate projects.
  * To design a natural language based lost-and-found system for the Hong Kong Airport.
  * Worked on accelerating the process of efficiently analysing multiple long videos using deep learning models and used React to build the front-end for the project.
  * Investigated multiple Zero-Shot Object Detection models as well as Nature Language Processing Models; Evaluated different model capabilities based on our self-created airport datasets and diverse evaluation criteria.

* **Traffic Characteristics Analysis of the Network** (Apr. 2023 - Jun. 2023)
  * Research Assistant to [Prof. Tong YANG](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1176/3703.htm) ([DSE](https://dse.pku.edu.cn){: .no-underline-black-link }@PKU).
  * Based on the high-performance traffic analysis platform built independently and the core traffic data collected, conducting comprehensive and in-depth traffic feature statistics and analysis from the link, traffic and packet level.
  * Learned about TCP/IP protocols and DNS packet rules and used Peking University's campus network traffic information as a dataset, resolving IP and domain name mapping relationships from pcap files containing only DNS.
 

## Work Experience

* **CTO & Co-founder, AIJobTech** (Oct. 2023 - present)
  * Engaged in the launch and early-stage funding of an AI-driven job matching startup.
      * Joined "[HKSTP Ideation Programme](https://www.hkstp.org/what-we-offer/incubation-acceleration-elite/ideation/){: .no-underline-black-link }" with the whole team.
  * Implemented AI recommendation systems for job matching and leveraged large language models for resume and personal statement optimization, as well as full-stack development.
  * Led the technical team in development and technical details to ensure efficient, high-quality delivery as the CTO.
