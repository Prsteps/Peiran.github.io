## Education
B.S. in Computer Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2021-2025(Expected)
* Major GPA: 3.765/4.0
* Dean's list(top 10% student among the engineering faculty)

## Research experience
Gaze-Based Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation

The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Research Assistant(under Prof. Qi Dou)                     September 2024 - Present 
▪ Developed a scheme for collecting dense weak supervision for medical image segmentation, utilizing a gaze annotation scheme paired with a contrastive learning approach. 
▪ Employed eye-tracking devices to gather gaze data, processing this data to enhance model training. 
▪ Conducted comparative studies against traditional manual annotation methods, demonstrating a significant reduction in the costs associated with medical image segmentation. 
Out-Of-Distribution Detection in Neural Networks
The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Research Assistant(under Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho)             June 2024 – August 2024
▪ Proposed a post-hoc activation shaping method based on the characteristics of neural networks and designed the corresponding algorithm to enhance OOD detection capabilities.
▪ Validated the effectiveness of the method across multiple datasets (SVHN, ImageNet), enhancing the neural networks’ capability to distinguish OOD data while maintaining classification accuracy.
▪ Presented the OOD project at a faculty-wide poster presentation in August 2024, showcasing innovative findings and methodologies to academic peers.
CubeU – A Content-Oriented Website Development
The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Website Developer                                        February 2024 – May 2024
▪ Developed client-side dynamic online platform with React and JavaScript, highly improved user experience and achieved better customer stickiness.
▪ Engineered and administered a MongoDB-based user database, significantly improving data efficiency and performance in storage and retrieval operations.
▪ Developed a tagging system utilizing regular expressions for content filtering and user recommendations, enhancing the platform's usability.
AI Methods for RNA-Disease Prediction in Healthcare
The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Research Assistant(under Prof. Yu Li)                             June 2023 – August 2023
▪ Collected and processed data from the LncRNADisease v3.0 database, preparing it for analysis in the lncRNA-disease interaction project.
▪ Developed and implemented an effective RNA-FM classification model to predict lncRNA-disease interactions, enhancing the understanding of ncRNA roles in disease mechanisms.
▪ Implemented support vector machine (a machine learning algorithms) to refine RNA-disease association predictions, resulting in models that are both more accurate and efficient in processing large datasets.
