## Projects

* **Fact or Fairness? Identifying Over-Balanced Issues** [[Poster](https://YanY-Henry.github.io/files/SummerResearch2024_Poster.pdf)]
  <span style="float: right;">Apr. 2024 - present</span>  
  *Supervisor: [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/michael-rung-tsong-lyu/) & [Dr. Jen-Tse Huang](https://penguinnnnn.github.io/index.html) ([ARISE](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/){: .no-underline-black-link }@[CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html){: .no-underline-black-link })*
  <span style="float: right;">Hong Kong SAR</span>
  * More details are to be updated.

* **Evaluation on the Vulnerability of Current Generative Models** [[Slides](https://YanY-Henry.github.io/files/SemesterProject2024_Slides.pdf)]
  <span style="float: right;">Feb. 2024 - Jun. 2024</span>  
  *Supervisor: [Prof. Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk](https://people.epfl.ch/sabine.susstrunk?lang=en) & [Dr. Daichi Zhang](https://daisy-zhang.github.io) ([IVRL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/){: .no-underline-black-link }@[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/){: .no-underline-black-link })*
  <span style="float: right;">Lausanne, Switzerland</span>
  * **"Jailbreak" Analysis & Security Enhancement**: Experimented with more than ten large language model (LLM) "jailbreak" techniques to identify persistent vulnerabilities. This led to help technology companies develop enhanced defence mechanisms that improve the security of their LLMs and the ability to resist the generation of harmful content.
  * **Advanced Alignment Circumventing Techniques**: Utilized reinforcement learning and greedy search to identify alternatives to sensitive words within the latent space to circumvent the alignment of the LLMs. These techniques circumvent traditional alignment mechanisms, exposing critical security vulnerabilities within LLMs.
  * **Attention Diversion Techniques for LLMs**: Designed an array of intricate input prompts and conducted extensive experiments with potentially harmful statements. These efforts effectively diverted LLM attention, facilitating precise identification of weaknesses and enabling targeted attack strategies.

* **Efficient Video Analytics** [[Poster](https://YanY-Henry.github.io/files/SummerResearch2023_Poster.pdf)]
  <span style="float: right;">Jun. 2023 - Sep. 2023</span>  
  *Supervisor: [Prof. Eric Chi Lik LO](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/eric-chi-lik-lo/) ([CPII](https://www.cpii.hk){: .no-underline-black-link }@[CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html){: .no-underline-black-link })*
  <span style="float: right;">Hong Kong SAR</span>
  * Won the **Best Project Award 2023** among 58 undergraduate projects.
  * **Multi-modal AI System for Lost-and-Found at Hong Kong International Airport**: Utilized CLIP and OWL-ViT models to craft a multi-modal lost-and-found system, harnessing user texts and images to search through extensive video data, resulting in a significant advancement in applying AI to improve airport services.
  * **Custom Dataset and AI Model Evaluation**: Created a tailored airport video dataset and established multi-modal algorithm evaluation standards. This effort led to the selection of high-performing multi-modal Zero-Shot Object Detection and NLP models, saving the airport lost-and-found system processing time by 5-8 hours.
  * **Frame Detection Optimization with Increased Tolerance**: Developed an algorithm to identify potential frames for lost items, overcoming challenges in pinpoint accuracy by experimenting with tolerance levels. This improved fault tolerance and made searching through large video footage more efficient, while ensuring high accuracy and recall rate.

* **Traffic Characteristics Analysis of the Network**
  <span style="float: right;">Apr. 2023 - Jun. 2023</span>  
  *Supervisor: [Prof. Tong YANG](https://yangtonghome.github.io) ([DSE](https://dse.pku.edu.cn){: .no-underline-black-link }@[PKU](https://english.pku.edu.cn){: .no-underline-black-link })*
  <span style="float: right;">Beijing, China</span>
  * **Developed an efficient platform** to analyze campus network traffic, examining link, traffic, and packet levels to identify user preferences.
  * **Mapped IP addresses** to domain names using TCP/IP and DNS packet analysis, extracting data from pcap files to understand network patterns.
  * **Analyzed campus network traffic** to identify top domains and peak times with C++ and streaming algorithms for parsing and in-depth analysis.
