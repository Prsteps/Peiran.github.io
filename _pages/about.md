## About me

I am YAN Yuhang Henry (闫禹杭), a junior undergraduate student at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science**. I'm also a memeber of the ELITE Stream of Faculty of Engineering. During my second year, I had an opportunity to study at **Peking University (PKU)** as an exchange student for a semester. Recently, I am trying to reach out to different areas of computer science to enrich my knowledge.

I am currently working on:

1. **Traffic Characteristics Analysis of the Network** under the supervision of Prof. Tong YANG at PKU.
2. **Efficient Joins on Video Data** under the supervision of Prof. Eric Chi Lik LO at CUHK.
