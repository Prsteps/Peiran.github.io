## About me

I am YAN Yuhang Henry (闫禹杭), a junior undergraduate student at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science**. I'm also a memeber of the ELITE Stream of Faculty of Engineering. During my second year and third year, I was offered two opportunities to spend a semester of exchange study at Peking University (PKU) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), respectively. Recently, I am trying to reach out to different areas of computer science to enrich my knowledge.

I am currently working on:

1. **Efficient Video Analytics** under the supervision of Prof. Eric Chi Lik LO at CUHK.  
   About: Algorithm, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
