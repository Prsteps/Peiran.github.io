## About me

I am a junior undergraduate student at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK)**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science**. I'm also a memeber of the ELITE Stream of Faculty of Engineering. During my second year, I had an opportunity to study at **Peking University(PKU)** as an exchange student for a semester. Recently, I am trying to expose myself to different areas of Computer Science to enrich my knowledge.

I am currently working on:

1. **Traffic Characteristics Analysis of the Network** under the supervision of [Prof. Tong YANG](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1176/3703.htm) at PKU.
2. **Efficient Joins on Video Data** under the supervision of [Prof. Eric Chi Lik Lo](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/eric-chi-lik-lo/) at CUHK.
