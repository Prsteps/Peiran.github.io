## About me
My name is LI Peiran 李沛苒, a final year computer science undergraduate from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xixin WU](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~wuxx/) (CUHK). Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by [Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/) (CUHK) as a reserach assiant. 

My research experiences have mainly centered on **AI for healthcare** and **Human-Computer Interaction**，I am also eager to explore different fields to enrich my research knowledge, particularly the applications of **large language models** and **Speech Generation** in healthcare and other areas.

💥 <span style="color:#e89b00">***I am actively seeking for research opportunities!***
