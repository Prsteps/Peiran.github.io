My name is LI Peiran（李沛苒), a final year computer science undergraduate from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). Currently, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. QI Dou](https://carrend.github.io/)(CUHK). Prior to this, I was also honored to be advised by [Prof. Tsung-Yi Ho](https://tsungyiho.github.io/)(CUHK) as a reserach assiant. 

My research experiences have mainly centered on **AI for healthcare** and **Trustworthy AI**，I am still trying to explore different fields to enrich my reserch knowledge.

***👀️ I am actively seeking for research opportunities!***
