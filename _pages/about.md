## About me

I am YAN Yuhang Henry (Èó´Á¶πÊù≠), a final year undergraduate student at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science**. I'm also a memeber of the ELITE Stream of Faculty of Engineering. During my second year and third year, I was offered two opportunities to spend a semester of exchange study at Peking University (**PKU**) and √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (**EPFL**), respectively. Recently, I am trying to reach out to different areas of computer science to enrich my knowledge.
