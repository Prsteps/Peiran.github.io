## About me

I am YAN Yuhang Henry (闫禹杭), a junior undergraduate student at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)**, pursuing a major in **Computer Science**. I'm also a memeber of the ELITE Stream of Faculty of Engineering. During my second year and third year, I was offered two opportunities to spend a semester of exchange study at Peking University (PKU) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), respectively. Recently, I am trying to reach out to different areas of computer science to enrich my knowledge.

I am currently working on:

1. **AIJobTech**, a start-up focusing on AI job hunting.  
   About: Full-stack development, Large language models and Recommendation systems.
